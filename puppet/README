Check_MK Plugin to check whether the puppet agent was run or is disabled.

    This plugin makes use of and distributes the puppetstatus scripts
    written by tmz[1].

        http://people.fedoraproject.org/~tmz/scripts/puppetstatus/puppetstatus

    The check will return:
    
     OK       - Puppet agent was last run within the specified timeframe and
                is not disabled.

     WARNING  - The agent wasn't run in N seconds but within the WARNING time range,
                or the agent is disabled (will also put the specified resons to the
                output).

     CRITICAL - The agent wasn't run in N seconds and reached the CRITICAL time range.
    
    The script was tested on the following Debian versions: Lenny, Squeeze
