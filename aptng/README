APT-NG - Check_MK Plugin to check for upgradeable Debian packages.

    Check upgradeable packages, and the age of the apt-cache. The agent plugin
    will return a list with upgradable package/reposititory source which are
    available for upgrade.

    ------- IMPORTANT NOTE -------

    This version of the check doesn't depend on python-apt anymore and won't
    update the package cache, in case it finds cron-apt installed on a system.

    Example Agent Output:

        <<<apt>>>
        2882
        6.0.3
        x11-common Debian-Security:6.0/stable

    You are able to confugure per repository severities.

        # 1 = WARNING
        # 2 = CRITICAL 
        apt_repository_severity = {
         'Debian-Security' : 2,
         'debian-volatile' : 1,
         'Unofficial'      : 1,
         '__default__'     : 1,
        }

    Eg.: in case we find a package from Debian-Security, the check will return CRITICAL.

    The script was tested on the following Debian versions: Etch, Lenny, Squeeze
