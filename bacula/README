Check_MK Plugin to check for the current state of your Bacula backup server.

    REQUIREMENTS
     * Debian [inventory based on installed package, easy to extend]
     * Bacula with Postgresql Backend

    This plugin will define four new checks for Bacula hosts:

        * bacula.errorvols

          Checks the state of available backup volumes and will report critical,
          if errounos volumes are found. In case of an error, it will as well
          return the names of these volumes.

          Use the bacula-clear-errvols script to resolve these issues.

        * bacula.freshness
          Checks whether all clients have an associated backup within the last
          30 hours.

        * bacula.fullbackups
          Checks whether all clients have an associated full-backup.

        * bacula.fullbackupspool
          Checks whether any volumes used for full-backups come from a full-backup pool.
    

    The script was tested on the following Debian versions: Squeeze
