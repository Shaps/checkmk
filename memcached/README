Check_MK Plugin to check a memcached instance.

    The client plugin will return the stats of a given memcached instance.
    
    The check will test two different ratios: 
        * memcached.hits the percentage of cache hits and.
        * memcached.size the percentage of usaged memory.
    
    The script was tested on the following Debian versions: Squeeze

// INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

    On your Check_MK clients:
    
        Install the following debian packages:
            * python-simplejson
            * python-pylibmc
        
        Copy plugins/memcached to your clients into /usr/lib/check_mk_agent/plugins/
    
    On your Nagios Server:
    
        Install the pyton-simplejson package and copy checks/memcached to your
        server into /usr/local/share/check_mk/scripts/

// TODO

    * The agent plugin and the check currently only support one memcached server,
      listening on the following address: 127.0.0.1:11211
      But could be extended, so it's able to detect or can be configured to
      support more than one instance.

    * Check where a value can be inserted, updated, deleted.

    * Check the time spent, to acomblish the insert, update, delete of a value.
